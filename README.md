- Hey Everyone, my name is Paul Thompson and I am the founder of BAIS House.
- BAIS stands for Branding, Applications, and Information Systems.
- We are a forward-thinking, tech-savvy group that always looks at what’s next.
- We don’t wait for innovation to emerge; we create it.
- We ask, “What’s on the horizon of tech? How can we get there first?”
- This leads us to use creativity to develop first-to-market applications, bringing them to life from concept to consumer.

- I would love to collaborate with new and seasoned programmers, coders, and developers - whatever it is you want to call yourself.
- Right now I am workiing ona few projects aimed to help, and/or progress the music industry on a low level to start, but have plans
- to expand that in the future.

- 📫 How to reach me: paul.thompson@baishouse.com
